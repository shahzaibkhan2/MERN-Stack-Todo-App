# Full Stack Spotify Clone Website (MERN Stack)


I Built a Full Stack (MERN) Spotify Clone Website which is functional, responsive and secured using JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS, Git and
Github, Context Api, ECMAScript, ExpressJs, NodeJs, Mongoose, MongoDB and ReactJs. This is a full stack (MERN Stack) Spotify website through which you can explore your favorite songs according to your will and can add your favorite songs to your playlist or create your own playlist.
This website also includes a separate Admin Panel through which you can keep track of your songs and albums in the website to properly add, change or remove the songs and albums. This Panel is only for the owner of the website. All the data used in this website is fully dynamic and is stored in the MongoDB database (Atlas). The returned data is then stored in a Context Api which is an advanced state management Hook in React. Have a look at this amazing website and don't forget to give it a star.
